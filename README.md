# AristaLabRequestor 
This is Hackathon BrewIT'24 Project. The primary goal of this app was to help Systest Team to make Lab Requests with visual interface to get rid of time consuming and manual work of drafting Lab Requests.

## üåê Overview

AristaLabRequestor is a web application designed to streamline the process of managing and generating network lab configurations, specifically tailored for Arista ACT Labs and SysTest Team lab requests. It provides a visual interface for editing existing YAML-based lab topologies and facilitates the creation of new lab requests, significantly enhancing efficiency and reducing manual errors in lab setup workflows.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Visual ACT Lab Topology Editor:**
    * **Load Existing Configurations:** Easily import existing ACT Lab YAML configuration files directly into the application.
    * **Interactive Canvas:** Visually represent and manipulate network topologies on an intuitive canvas. Drag, drop, connect, and configure devices with ease.
    * **Real-time Editing:** Modify device configurations, interface connections, and other topology parameters through a user-friendly graphical interface.
    * **Download Updated YAML:** Export the visually edited lab topology back into a standard ACT Lab YAML file, ready for deployment or version control.

* **SysTest Lab Request Generator:**
    * **Streamlined Request Creation:** Generate standardized lab requests for the SysTest Team, ensuring all necessary information is captured consistently.
    * **Automated Formatting:** Reduce manual effort and potential errors in formatting lab request documents.

* **User-Friendly Settings Menu:**
    * Customize application preferences for a personalized and efficient workflow.

* **Upcoming Feature: Load Existing SysTest Lab Requests:**
    * The ability to import and review previously generated SysTest Lab Request files will be added soon, providing a comprehensive history and easy modification of past requests.
